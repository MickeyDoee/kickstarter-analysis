# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this Project was to see the difference between how well Louise's play Fever did compared to the other campaigns. It shows the entire overview of the other campaings/ the outcomes based on their goals. This Data set also shows the difference of Outcomes between Launch Dates and Goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### The Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date favored that move campaings were successfully launched during the summer time. During the end of the year, we can see that the success rate dropped tremendously. Also, another comparisison that can be noted is that a majority of 

### The Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals showed that as Goals went up in price, the more likely they were to fail. Success for plays were best when the goals were cheaper.

### Some Challenges and Difficulties Encountered was having to redo the entire file due to missing data. When working on Outcomes Based on Goal, I had missing/ partial data causing incorrect Data points when making the Line Chart. During the second attempt of creating the data I was able to display all data correctly for both by Launch Date and Goal.

## Results

- One conclusion that was made for Outcomes based on Launch Date is that when Theaters were launched during the Summer/ Spring, they has the highest success rate. During the SUmmer more people are available to go out and participate which is why during the summer the outcomes are higher/ successful. The second conclusion is during the Winter/ Fall, Theaters had a higher fail rate. There were less theathers being conducted vs. during the Spring/ Summer.

- I can conclude that for Outcomes Based on Goal, Plays started to fail more as the goal started to increase. Plays were successful when the goals were lower.

- Some limitations for this Data Set is not including a seperate chart for total pledged. Looking at the Kickstarter sheet, there is total pledge and this can be used to identify if pledges were not met and possibly show the reason for plays failing. 

- One possible chart that can be included is a Pivot Table with Line Chart showing the Outcomes based on total Pledged towards total goal. This can show where the total pledged does not balance with the goal and what may have potentially occured during the time of the play being combed together.
